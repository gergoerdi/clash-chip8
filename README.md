CHIP-8 implemented in CÎ»aSH
===========================

Originally implemented for RetroChallenge 2018/09. Progress was
documented at https://gergo.erdi.hu/blog/tags/retrochallenge/ This
repository is a rewrite for my upcoming book on retrocomputing with
Clash. The book is still WIP, but the code of the various examples is
accumulating at http://github.com/gergoerdi/

It uses the library that the book builds up chapter by chapter, which
can be found separately at https://github.com/gergoerdi/retroclash-lib/

It targets the [Nexys A7-50T FPGA development board][1], but the only IO it
needs is VGA output and a four-by-four keypad input, so it should port
easily to any other FPGA platform.

## Building into a bitfile

The included `mk` script runs the included Shake rules and creates a
Xilinx bitfile ready to upload on a Nexys A7-50T. First, create a
`build.mk` file that describes your local build environment and your
build target:

```
VIVADO_ROOT=/path/to/vivado/installation
TARGET=nexys-a7-50t
```

Alternatively, if you are using the Vivado toolchain via a wrapper
script (e.g. to run it in Docker), instead of `VIVADO_ROOT`, you can
set `VIVADO` to the wrapper script's name:

```
VIVADO=/path/to/vivado-wrapper
```

The script will be called with the first argument being the Vivado
tool's name, and the rest of the arguments are the arguments to the
tool itself.

Once you have `build.mk`, you can run `mk` and upload to your FPGA
board the `Top.bit` file from the
`_build/nexys-a7-50t/CHIP8/CHIP8.runs/impl_1` directory.

## Building the simulators

There are three simulators included:

* A ["very high-level"][2] simulation that only uses the CPU
  implementation from Clash, and the rest is Haskell.
  
* A logic board simulation that simulates not just the CPU, but also
  the memory elements, including the memory address decoding.
  
* A low-level simulation that runs the whole board in Verilator, and
  interprets the VGA signal output.

To build the first two simulations, just do a `stack build`. To build
the low-level simulation, you need to install Verilator from
https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator, and set the `verilator` flag
when building; i.e. do `stack build  --flag clash-chip8:verilator` (or
the equivalent setting when using Cabal directly).
